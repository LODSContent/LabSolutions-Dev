## Virtual Machine Licensing

>[+] Windows Virtual Machines
>
Windows licensing will vary from template to template, and even from VM to VM within those templates. There are two versions of Windows which will have unique licensing requirements depending on your use.
- Windows Server virtual machines will not be licensed within Skillable provided templates. There are two options in licensing Windows Server virtual machines:
    1. **License on your own** - This would utilize your own Windows Server licensing keys in a method that corresponds to the licensing agreement between your organization and Microsoft.
    1. **Use Skillable provided licensing** - If you would like for Skillable to license your Windows Server virtual machine, please submit a [Lab Services ticket](https://lod.one/support). If you have not already discussed the fees that relate to using Skillable licensing with your Skillable Account Representative, you should reach out to them first to discuss cost implications.
  >
  > **ALERT** This will incur charges for ALL virtual machines in a lab profile (including non-Windows machines) at a rate according to your customer contract.
- Windows 10 virtual machines will be supplied with the **Enterprise** edition of Windows. This means that virtual machines will never shut themselves down due to too much time running without a license. However, these virtual machines should be licensed by you based on the licensing requirements between your organization and Microsoft.

Distributions of Linux provided in your template will utilize open source licensing, and therefore do not require any special configuration.
