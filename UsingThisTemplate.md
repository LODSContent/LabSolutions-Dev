## Modify Virtual Environment
Lab environments may contain Virtual Machines, Containers or Cloud settings. These can be modified either prior to copying the template, or after.

If the provided virtual machines or containers require changes/updates to, or addition/removal of software, you may perform this now. Once you have completed the updates you require, or if the virtual machines or containers do not need any software modifications, please advance to the **Save Modified Environment** section to perform tasks such as modifying hardware settings (including RAM and CPU), removing components like entire virtual machines or networks, or making changes to Cloud settings.
