Virtual Machine and Lab Profile Characteristics for the Base Environment

Within this foundational environment, we delve into the intricacies of virtual machines and lab profiles. The details encompass the following key aspects:

Virtual Machine Configuration: A comprehensive breakdown of the virtual machine setup, including specifications such as CPU allocation, memory, storage, and any specialized hardware configurations.
Network Settings: An exploration of the network architecture, addressing both local and external connectivity. This entails IP addressing, subnets, routing, and any security measures in place.
Cloud Settings and Lifecycle Actions: If applicable, we examine cloud-specific settings, such as integration with public cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). Additionally, we consider lifecycle actions, such as provisioning, scaling, and deprovisioning, which impact the overall environment dynamics.
These meticulously documented details serve as a foundational reference, ensuring clarity and precision throughout the lab build.
